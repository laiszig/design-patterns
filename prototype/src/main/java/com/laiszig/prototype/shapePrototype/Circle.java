/**
 *  Concrete prototype. The cloning method creates a new object

 *  passing the current object as the constructor's argument.
 *  Performing all the actual copying in the constructor helps to
 *  keep the result consistent: the constructor will not return a
 *  result until the new object is fully built; thus, no object
 *  can have a reference to a partially-built clone.
